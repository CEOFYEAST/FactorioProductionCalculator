Vue Considerations
- Using the proper channels when dealing with communication between parent and child, sibling and sibling, etc.
- Seperating systems involved in business logic and ui logic
  * for example, using an event bus based on the component tree for the UI, and an event bus seperated from it for the business logi
    - the component tree event bus can be based off the root component, or off a parent component; multiple different busses can exist
    - could use a store for the business logi; however, stores for spa component logic are a bad idea
- Coupling can get very out of hand with Vue 
- Seperation of concerns; should have reusable components purely used to interact with the user, and parent components used to organize these components as well as handle the business logic
- There should no communication between presentational components from different subtrees, with each tree being defined by it's root application component
  * for example, the nav bar from my app application component shouldn't communicate with the presentational component child of a nested application component such as TheMain
- If I want to design a large, complex website, I have to treat it with the respect and attention it deserves
