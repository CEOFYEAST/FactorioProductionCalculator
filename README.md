# Factorio Production Calculator

A web app created to aid users in designing their Factorio factories.

## Summary

The main functionality of the app centers around production chains. Users will be able to visualize production chains, as well as add and remove products from any step in these chains. All the user need do is input the item/s their factory requires, and the app will handle all the necessary calculations.

Lots of apps like this already exist, such as this wonderful website: 
https://kirkmcdonald.github.io/calc.html#data=1-1-110&items=advanced-circuit:f:1

However, I plan to implement user profiles; this will allow users to continue modeling the production chains of their factories as they grow over time.

## Keep up with updates

I've been posting updates and insights on the project to my development instagram account. I'll try and get a proper blog up soon so you don't have to use that infernal app.
